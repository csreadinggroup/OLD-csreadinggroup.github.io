## Career

I'm the guy that makes embedded devices come to life the first time, ensures the low-level operating system code runs reliably, and ensure that the application runs successfully on embedded devices.

I have years of experience in implementing custom softwares on a variety of embedded platforms. These solutions range from low-level boot loaders and kernel drivers to high-level libraries interfaces to those device drivers.

I have an interest in building embedded software and embedded firmware for embedded devices in a reliable manner leveraging existing technologies and source control management tools.

## Free Time
Outside of work I hack on opensource software, dabble with development boards like Raspberry-Pi.
